          ✅ ISSUE FIXED: call_switch REMOVED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

PROBLEM:
--------
Documentation was showing 3 parameters:
❌ receiver_id
❌ call_type  
❌ call_switch  ← THIS WAS WRONG!

But the actual controller only accepts 2 parameters!


SOLUTION:
---------
✅ Removed call_switch from ALL documentation
✅ Verified controller has ONLY 2 parameters
✅ Updated web docs (calls.blade.php)


RESULT:
-------
API Documentation NOW CORRECT:
✅ receiver_id  (required)
✅ call_type    (required)

NO call_switch!


CORRECT REQUEST FORMAT:
-----------------------
{
  "receiver_id": "USR_1234567890",
  "call_type": "AUDIO"
}


WHY call_switch WAS BAD:
------------------------
- It bypassed busy status validation
- Created security hole
- Bad design from HIMA app
- We removed it in our critical analysis


VERIFICATION:
-------------
✅ CallController.php → ONLY 2 params
✅ calls.blade.php → ONLY 2 params shown
✅ calls-complete.blade.php → ONLY 2 params
✅ All docs match the actual API


STATUS: ✅ FIXED AND VERIFIED
