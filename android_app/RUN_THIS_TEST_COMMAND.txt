# Quick Test Commands

## Test Call Cancellation (Male ends before Female accepts)

### Step 1: Start Logging on Both Devices

Terminal 1 (Male device):
adb -s MALE_DEVICE_ID logcat -c && adb -s MALE_DEVICE_ID logcat | grep -E "cancelCall|call:cancel|endCall.*Waiting"

Terminal 2 (Female device):
adb -s FEMALE_DEVICE_ID logcat -c && adb -s FEMALE_DEVICE_ID logcat | grep -E "call:cancelled|CALL CANCELLED|IncomingCallActivity"

### Step 2: Perform Test

1. Male calls Female
2. Female's phone rings (incoming call screen shows)
3. Male taps "End Call" BEFORE Female accepts
4. Watch the logs in both terminals

### Step 3: Check Results

MALE DEVICE should show:
✅ "Waiting for receiver: true"
✅ "🚫 Caller ending call before receiver accepts"
✅ "📤 EMITTING call:cancel to server"
✅ "✅ call:cancel emitted successfully"

FEMALE DEVICE should show:
✅ "🚫 CALL CANCELLED EVENT RECEIVED (WebSocket)"
✅ "✅ MATCH! Caller cancelled this call"
✅ "🛑 STOPPING RINGING"

IF FEMALE DEVICE SHOWS NOTHING:
❌ Backend is not forwarding the call:cancelled event
❌ Need to tell backend developer to implement it

If you don't know device IDs:
adb devices

Then replace MALE_DEVICE_ID and FEMALE_DEVICE_ID with actual device IDs
